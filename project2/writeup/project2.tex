\section*{MTMW14 Project 2: Using Shallow Water Equations to Model Ocean Gyres}

\section*{SN: 23865130}

\section*{Introduction}

In this project a model of a large scale ocean gyre is developed. The model is based on the Shallow
Water Equations (SWEs), on a $\beta$-plane linearised about a resting state:

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:swe1} 
    \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} & =  - H (\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} ),  \\
    \label{eqn:swe2} 
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} & =  + (f_0 + \beta y) v - g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} - \gamma u + \frac{\tau_x}{\rho H}, \\
    \label{eqn:swe3} 
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} & =  - (f_0 + \beta y) u - g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} - \gamma v + \frac{\tau_y}{\rho H}.
\end{align}

Here $\eta$ represents the height perturbation, $u$ and $v$ represent the column averaged zonal and meridional
velocity perturbations. $H$ is the average height, $f_0$ and $\beta$ are the Coriolis and $\beta$
parameters, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\gamma$ represents drag processes, and $\tau_x$
and $\tau_y$ represent the wind stress forcings. The equations were solved using a square domain,
with the sides being given by $L$.  The values used for the parameters were: 

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ c|r l } 
	parameter & value & unit \\ 
	\hline
	$L$ & \SI{1e6}{} & \SI{}{m} \\
	$H$ & \SI{1000}{} & \SI{}{m} \\ 
	$f_0$ & \SI{1e-4}{} & \SI{}{s^{-1}} \\ 
	$\beta$ & \SI{1e-11}{} & \SI{}{m^{-1} s^{-1}} \\ 
	$g$ & \SI{10}{} & \SI{}{m s^{-2}} \\ 
	$\gamma$ & \SI{1e-6}{} & \SI{}{s^{-1}} \\ 
	$\rho$ & \SI{1000}{} & \SI{}{kg m^{-3}} \\ 
	$\tau_x$ & $-cos(\frac{\pi y}{L})$ & \SI{}{kg s^{-2}} \\ 
	$\tau_y$ & 0 & \SI{}{kg s^{-2}}  \\ 
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Following \textcite{beckers1993stability}, the SWEs are solved on an Arakawa-C grid using the
forward-backward time scheme. The Arakawa-C grid was chosen so that e.g. spatial derivatives of $u$
in the $x$ direction would be available at the points where $\eta$ is calculated. The domain is
taken to be the size of the $\eta$ grid points, as can be seen in Fig.\ \ref{fig:arakawa_c_grid}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=300px]{figures/arakawa_c_grid}
    \caption{Shows where $\eta$, $u$ and $v$ are calculated on the Arakawa-C grid for $\Delta x =
	\Delta y =$ \SI{200}{km} (lower than the lowest resolution used in this project, for
	illustration only). Note, $u$ is one bigger in the $x$ direction than $\eta$ (and similar
	for $v$ in $y$ direction), and therefore the minimum and maximum $u$ coordinates lie
	$\frac{\Delta x}{2}$ outside the domain (and similar for $v$). The red grid-point values
	show values which are held at $0$ due to the boundary conditions. }
    \label{fig:arakawa_c_grid}
\end{figure}

First $\eta$, $u$ then $v$ are calculated (in that order):

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:swe_arakawa1} 
    \eta^{n+1} & =  \eta^n- H \Delta t (\frac{\partial u^n}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v^n}{\partial y} ),  \\
    \label{eqn:swe_arakawa2} 
    u^{n+1} & = u^n + (f_0 + \beta y) \Delta t v^n - g \Delta t \frac{\partial \eta^{n+1}}{\partial
    x} - \gamma \Delta t u^n + \Delta t \frac{\tau_x}{\rho H}, \\
    \label{eqn:swe_arakawa3} 
    v^{n+1} & = v^n - (f_0 + \beta y) \Delta t u^{n+1} - g \Delta t \frac{\partial \eta^{n+1}}{\partial y} -
    \gamma \Delta t v^n + \Delta t \frac{\tau_y}{\rho H}.
\end{align}

Second $\eta$, $v$ then $u$ are calculated (note, the order of $u$ and $v$ calculations has been
swapped):

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:swe_arakawa4} 
    \eta^{n+2} & =  \eta^{n+1}- H \Delta t (\frac{\partial u^{n+1}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial
    v^{n+1}}{\partial y} ),  \\
    \label{eqn:swe_arakawa5} 
    v^{n+2} & = v^{n+1} - (f_0 + \beta y) \Delta t u^{n+1} - g \Delta t \frac{\partial \eta^{n+2}}{\partial y} -
    \gamma \Delta t v^{n+1} + \Delta t \frac{\tau_y}{\rho H}, \\
    \label{eqn:swe_arakawa6} 
    u^{n+2} & = u^{n+1} + (f_0 + \beta y) \Delta t v^{n+2} - g \Delta t \frac{\partial
	\eta^{n+1}}{\partial x} - \gamma \Delta t u^{n+1} + \Delta t \frac{\tau_x}{\rho H}.
\end{align}

To calculate $u$ on the other two grids (see Fig.\ \ref{fig:arakawa_c_grid}), spatial averaging must
be used. E.g. to calculate $u$ on the $\eta$ grid, the average of two $u$ grid-points in the $x$
direction must be used, and to calculate $u$ on the $v$ grid, four grid-points in the $x$ and $y$
directions must be used. Similar calculations apply to $v$ and $\eta$ on the other grids.
Derivatives are calculated using the two values on either side of the grid-point where they are
needed (using the midpoint method which is 2\ts{nd} order accurate, indeed this is the strength of
the Arakawa-C grid).

\section*{Task A}

To model the Western Boundary Current (WBC), a sufficient number of grid-points must span this
distance. If the size of the WBC is taken to be $\frac{1}{10}$ \ts{th} of the zonal extent of the
domain, or \SI{100}{km}, and four grid-points are required across this to capture its variation,
this would mean a minimum spatial resolution of $\Delta x = 25\, km$ should be used. In this Task, a
value of $\Delta x = \Delta y = 20\, km$ was used. Kinematic boundary conditions are used throughout
this study, i.e. $u$ is held at $0$ on the eastern and western boundaries, $v$ is held at $0$ on the
northern and southern boundaries (see Fig.\ \ref{fig:arakawa_c_grid}).

The fastest signals propagating in this system are gravity-inertia waves. These have a phase speed
of $\sqrt{g H}$, and following \textcite{beckers1993stability}, this can be used to calculate an
upper bound for the CFL criterion, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:cfl_strict} 
    \sqrt{(\sqrt{g H} \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x})^2 + (\sqrt{g H} \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta y})^2} <=
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\\
\end{equation}

will be a necessary condition for the scheme to be stable. In practice, at the first resolution, it
was found that the less stringent requirement of

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:cfl_lax} 
    \sqrt{(\sqrt{g H} \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x})^2 + (\sqrt{g H} \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta y})^2} <=
    1\\
\end{equation}

was necessary to ensure numerical stability (from empirical experimentation). The first CFL
criterion will be referred to as the strict criterion, and the second the lax criterion. In light of
this, in this task $\Delta t$ was taken to be \SI{139}{s} so as to just satisfy this lax criterion.
Satisfying the lax criterion allows for a larger timestep and therefore less time is needed to run
the simulations.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=300px]{figures/task_a}
    \caption{Four plots showing $u$, $v$ and $\eta$ along three different zonal/meridional extents
	after one day - (a), (b) and (c). Plot (d) shows $\eta$ over the whole domain after one
    day.}
    \label{fig:task_a}
\end{figure}
% Say something about Rossby radius of deformation and link to spatial resolution.
% Justify timestep/etc.

The model was run for one day, and various plots of $u$, $v$ and $\eta$ are shown in Fig.\
\ref{fig:task_a}. Overall, an anti-clockwise gyre is set up, as can be seen in plots (a) and (b)
because $u$ is negative along the southern boundary, and $v$ is positive along the western boundary.
Plot (d) shows that the height perturbation, $\eta$, is almost symmetrical after one day, although
anomalously low values can be seen in the northeast and southwest corners.

\section*{Task B}

The energy stored in the gyre can be calculated by summing the contributions from the kinetic energy
(terms one and two in the integrand in Equation \ref{eqn:energy}) and the gravitational potential
energy (term three):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:energy} 
    E(u, v, \eta) = \int_0^L \int_0^L \frac{1}{2} \rho ( H ( u^2 + v^2) + g \eta^2) dx dy
\end{equation}

% TODO: CFL.
This can be approximated over the domain using Simpson's rule in 2D. This can then be calculated for
every timestep, as is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:task_b_energy}. For this figure, the model was run at
two resolutions: once as before with $\Delta x = \Delta y = $ \SI{20}{km}, and once with $\Delta x
= \Delta y = $ \SI{10}{km} (i.e. twice the spatial resolution). A time step of $\Delta t = $
\SI{49}{s} was use in both cases, so that the strict CFL criterion is just satisfied for the high
resolution run and that only changes in the spatial resolution are being compared between the two
runs. (It was found that running the model at the higher resolution with only the lax criterion
being satisfied lead to numerical instability after around \SI{100}{days}.) The model was run for 200
days in each case, and it can be seen that the energy reaches a peak at around \SI{70}{days} before
reducing by 2.05\%(1.27\%) for $\Delta x = 20$ \SI{}{km} ($\Delta x = 10$ \SI{}{km}) over the next
\SI{130}{days}. The variation from day 140 to day 200 is 0.0020\% (-0.025\%) for $\Delta x = 20$
\SI{}{km} ($\Delta x = 10$ \SI{}{km}), showing that the model has reached a steady state by day 200.

\section*{Task C}

Given that the energy in the model has reached a steady state after \SI{200}{days}, it can be
compared to the steady state analytical solution as found in \textcite{musgrave1985numerical}. The
only unknown in these equations is the value of $\eta_0$, for which the modelled value of $\eta(0,
\frac{L}{2})$ is used. One way of doing these comparisons is to work out the perturbations of $u$,
$v$ and $\eta$ as defined by e.g. $u' = u - u_{st}$ ($u_{st}$ is the steady state solution), then
calculating the energy difference using Equation \ref{eqn:energy} - $E(u', v', \eta')$. Using this
equation, when $\Delta x = 20$ \SI{}{km}, the total energy difference between the analytical and the
modelled steady state solution is \SI{18.4}{TJ}, and when $\Delta x = 10$ \SI{}{km}, the total
energy difference is \SI{4.99}{TJ}.  Therefore, increasing the resolution increases the accuracy of
the modelled steady state solution.  The 2\ts{nd} order spatial accuracy of the 2D SWE numerical
model on an Arakawa-C grid can be seen from the fact that when the resolution is doubled, the error,
as measured by the total energy difference, is approximately four times smaller. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=300px]{figures/task_b_energy}
    \caption{The effect of spatial resolution on the total energy of the system. Doubling the
    spatial resolution (blue curve) increases the overall energy of the system. It also reduces the
energy difference between the analytical steady state solution and the steady state obtained by
running the SWE model for \SI{200}{days}.}
    \label{fig:task_b_energy}
\end{figure}


\section*{Task D}

One way of solving a non-linear version of the SWE equations is to implement a semi-Lagrangian
numerical scheme. Here the full Lagrangian rates of change ($\frac{D}{Dt}$ as opposed to
$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$) are used, and the departure point of each of each grid-point is
calculated to work out the previous value of $u$, $v$ and $\eta$ to be used. It is therefore
necessary to calculate the departure points for each of the $u$, $v$ and $\eta$ grids used in the
Arakawa-C grid.  To calculate the departure point, the $\boldsymbol{u} =  ($u$, $v$)$ field at two
previous timesteps is used. Following Durran pp366-368, first, a 2\ts{nd} order estimate for
$\boldsymbol{u}^{n + \frac{1}{2}}$ is calculated using $\boldsymbol{u}^{n + \frac{1}{2}} =
\frac{3}{2}  \boldsymbol{u}^{n} - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{u}^{n-1}$. This is then used to calculate
a value of $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}$, the departure point, through the use of an intermediate
departure point using the following formulae:

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:sl_update1} 
    \boldsymbol{x_{*}} = \boldsymbol{x}^{n+1} - \boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}^{n+1}, t^n)
    \frac{\Delta t}{2},\\
    \label{eqn:sl_update2} 
    \boldsymbol{\tilde{x}}^n = \boldsymbol{x}^{n+1} - \boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x_{*}},
    t^{n+\frac{1}{2}}) \Delta t.\\
\end{align}

The departure points tell us where to take the values of $u$, $v$ and $\eta$ from the previous
timestep. However, it is unlikely that these departure points will lie on grid-points, therefore it
is necessary to interpolate between the values of these three fields to calculate the values at the
departure points. This is achieved using the \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]|RectBivariateSpline|
class from the \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]|scipy.interpolate| namespace. By default this uses a
2D cubic spline interpolation, and this was used to implement the interpolation of the three fields
in this Task. It also gracefully handles the extrapolation of points which are outside of its domain
by using the value of the nearest point in the domain of interpolation, which is useful for this
study. Once the values of the $u$, $v$ and $\eta$ fields have been calculated at the departure points
for the three grids, the same forward-backward time scheme used before is used to update the three
fields. 

Interestingly, the semi-Lagrangian scheme was found to be more unstable for larger values of $\Delta
t$ than the Eulerian scheme empirically. That it should be unstable is to be expected:
inertia-gravity waves will still provide a limit on its stability. (Although this can be removed by
treating inertia-gravity waves semi-implicitly - not done in this study) It was found that running
at a \SI{20}{km} resolution, a time resolution of \SI{75}{s} was necessary for the semi-Lagrangian
scheme to be stable. This is used below.

A comparison of the two schemes can be seen if Fig.\ \ref{fig:task_d_eta}, which shows plots of
$\eta$ for both schemes run with $\Delta x = \Delta y = $ \SI{20}{km}, and $\Delta t = $
\SI{75}{s}, after \SI{1}{day} and \SI{100}{days}. The two schemes are clearly very similar, with
almost identical magnitudes for $\eta$ after both time periods. However, the semi-Lagrangian scheme
is less symmetrical after \SI{100}{days}, which may be due to the fact that the equations that it is
solving are the non-linear counterparts to the equations solved by the first scheme.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=300px]{figures/task_d_eta}
    \caption{Contour plots of $\eta$ for the original Eulerian scheme ((a) and (c)), and the
	semi-Lagrangian scheme ((b) and (d)) after \SI{1}{day} and \SI{100}{days}.}
    \label{fig:task_d_eta}
\end{figure}

Finally, the total energy between the original Eulerian scheme and the semi-Lagrangian scheme can be
compared, as is done in Fig.\ \ref{fig:task_d_energy}. Here, the two schemes are run again with the
above settings for \SI{100}{days}. The two schemes give very similar energies throughout the run,
with the semi-Lagrangian scheme having a consistently slightly lower energy, perhaps due to the
asymmetries from the non-linearity as noted above.

All functions were coded using numpy array broadcasting instead of for loops, substantially speeding
up the run time of the functions. The semi-Lagrangian scheme takes longer to run than the Eulerian
scheme, due to the extra interpolation needed at each timestep.
